# Animal Shelter Manager
This full-stack web application allows users to browse available pets, browse adopted pets, and apply to become a volunteer at the Kindness and Dedication Divine Shelter. The shelter primarily serves senior animals and pairs them with senior citizens.

## Project Description
The website presents a user interface with options to view pets and apply to become a volunteer. Approved volunteers can add pets, update pets, and view the auto-updated volunteer directory. I was a member of a five-person team that met regularly with a Scrum master and Product Owner to gauge our progress and check to see that we were meeting deadlines and producing a minimum viable product.

### Technologies
This application incorporates Java and Spring Boot in the back end, which houses user authentication, pet objects, and volunteer applications. The objects are stored in a Postgres database and modified in the front end. The front end incorporates Vue.js, HTML, and CSS to display pages and take in user input.

### Challenges
This project challenged our group to create a full-stack application throughout the SDLC. We carefully selected appropriate database tables, endpoints, axios calls, and user interfaces that work together in a cohesive application.
